# Klartext - Easily manage your Kindle Highlights and Notes
The thing I love most about my Kindle is the highlight and note feature. It’s a pity there isn’t a way to manage and share them in an easy way. After fiddling around in python with some cli batch scripts I decided to make a more user friendly and go for a proper user interface.

# Desktop and Web
There’s a web and a desktop version. The web version is as complete as the desktop version except for the Kindle auto detect function. Open the app, plugin your kindle and you’re ready to share!

**I’m currently working on the binaries!**

## Techniques
* App.js (for desktop version)
* Coffeescript
* Twitter Bootstrap
* Modernizr
