# Klartext - Easily manage your Kindle Highlights and Notes
The thing I love most about my Kindle is the highlight and note feature. It’s a pity there isn’t a way to manage and share them in an easy way. After fiddling around in python with some cli batch scripts I decided to make a more user friendly and go for a proper user experience, resulting in Klartext.

## Status
**I’m currently working on the binaries for desktop version! Compile your own version with app.js.  
Web version only tested with chrome!  
Only tested with Kindle 3 clippings, searching for others!**

## Desktop and Web
There’s a web and a desktop version. The web version is as complete as the desktop version except for the Kindle auto detect function. Open the app, plugin your kindle and you’re ready to share!
